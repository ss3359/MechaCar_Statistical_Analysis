## Linear Regression To Predict MPG
Here is the linear function that best descibes the trend in the data. 

### Figure 1

Here are the results for the lienar regression for each variable with respect to miles per gallon for each vehicle. 

### Figure 2

According to the results, the variables that provide a non-random amount of variance to miles per gallon are the intercept, the vehicle length, anf the ground clearance. This is because their respective probabilities are extremily small. Also, from the data in Figure 2, we have an multiple R-squared value of 0.7149 and a p-value of 5.35e-11. Since our p-value is less than a significance value of 0.05, there is significant evidence to reject the null hypothesis implying that the slope is zero. Therefore, the slope is not zero. The multiple R-squared value means 71.5 percent of the data is explained using this linear regression model. This presents very strong correlation between the variables presented in the dataset. This implies the model can predict miles per gallon of the cars effectively.
